# Features and Findings
We investigate applicant demographics, employer characteristics, and geographic trends using datasets from the past three years. Our insights reveal that younger professionals (25-34 years), applicants with master’s degrees, and those targeting technology roles in states like California, Texas, and Washington have higher approval rates, while gender disparities remain significant. 

# License
This project uses the MIT license, people are free to work on the file and contribute. The file is not a finished product, and it would be interesting to see what insights others can identify.
